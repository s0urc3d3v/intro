# intro
This is a guide that I have created that is designed to help along those who need help begining with java.  When I learned
to program the number of resources was large but there where alot of basic concepts that I missed teaching myself to program
on the internet.  I have tried to help those of you who need a good starting place with both example code and a long explaination
I hope that this is informative and helps you get off the ground quickly.  Enjoy!
##For referances
You can use the gist for a walkthrought or just jump right into the code [here](https://github.com/s0urc3d3v3l0pm3nt/intro/blob/master/src/main.java)
The code is hevily marked up with comments to help you along and is designed as a referance not to actually be used as
it does nothing
