# Intro
This is a guide that I have created that is designed to help along those who need help beginning with java.  When I learned
to program the number of resources was large but there where a lot of basic concepts that I missed teaching myself to program
on the internet.  I have tried to help those of you who need a good starting place with both example code and a long explanation.
I hope that this is informative and helps you get off the ground quickly.  Enjoy!
##For references
You can use the [gist](https://gist.github.com/s0urc3d3v3l0pm3nt/97ad3080eaec8fa2f1bd) for a walkthrough or just jump right into the code [here](https://github.com/s0urc3d3v3l0pm3nt/intro/blob/master/src/main.java).

The code is heavily marked up with comments to help you along and is designed as a reference not to actually be used as
it does nothing.
